This year, the NY Regional is combining all three, for the ultimate Midway interactive art trifecta at Burning Man.  \r\n\r\nEach visitor to the Mad Sorcerer's Workshop creates one tiny clay creature and adds it to the world growing on the shelves of an infinity box.  Visitors are encouraged to interact with each other, to cooperate, and to let their imaginations roam, molding polka dot trees, green cows, castles, dinosaurs, and UFOs.  Make a blue fish, your friend can make a red bird, the next person will make a small man, together we'll have the beginnings of a whole new world, with the reflections of the infinity box making it look like there's whole schools and flocks of strange creatures and a crowd of people, all interacting.\r\n\r\nYou get to be the Mad Sorcerer, create whole worlds in your crystal ball, just to mess with them.  You get to say how creative and lovely your pet world will be.  There's no skill required, no creation too boring or too creative.  A red, and yellow and purple castle?  Yes!  A small brown snake?  Yes!  Every play-doh creature has a place with us.\r\n\r\nWant to see how the project is going?  Want to Contribute and Volunteer?

Each year the journals will make the annual journey home so they can added to and enjoyed again and again...\r\nWe open when the sun comes up (or whenever we feel like it), and stay serving most of the day (or until we are sick of it), always providing a place for weary burners to rest throughout the day and then kicking up the party at night.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T14:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T14:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T14:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T14:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T14:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-03T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-03T14:00:00+00:00"}],"title":"Morning Cocktails","event_id":19531,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":19531,"url":"","print_description":"Start your morning right or find a hair of the dog from last night - mimosas, palomas, coffee, play games, tell your tales from the playa.","event_type":{"label":"Gathering\/Party","id":2,"abbr":"prty"},"other_location":"Morning Cock n Tales inside the Gypsy Nebula Village 3:00 plaza"},"393":{"uid":"rMGhvR7xzDeNWxXzoZ7m","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IXhoEAG","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T19:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T20:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T19:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T20:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T19:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T20:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T19:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T20:00:00+00:00"}],"check_location":0,"id":19069,"event_type":{"id":7,"abbr":"perf","label":"Performance"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Flying Panda Brigade Aerialists","event_id":19069,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"flying-panda-brigade-aerialists","url":"http:\/\/www.playajoy.org","location":"Comfort and Joy","print_description":"Comfort & Joy presents an aerialist extravaganza where Benn Mendoza & his merry band of flying fools will be perform feats of aerial deliciousness.","desc":"The Playing Panda Brigade presents assorted aerial shenanigans on the Pink Rig at Comfort & Joy Monday - Thursday evenings shorts after sunset.

The average stay of a refugee in a camp is 17 years. Since WWII the hosting and management of a refugee community in such camps has not changed. Till the day of today refugee camps are harsh survival environments where people risk exploitation, are hopeless and rules of the strongest apply. \r\n\r\nAfter being involved in the epicenter of the refugee crisis on the Greek island of Lesvos I came to the knowledge that there is such a big difference to be made in this global issue if we would stop seeing refugees, victims of injustice. Instead we should approach them as individuals with talents, opportunities equal to our own standards and with the same needs. We should be aware that if we would invest in people that have lost everything this investment will be returned to us in gratefulness and willingness to contribute in their own succes. You get what you give...\r\n\r\nIn creating communities that thrive you should start with environments that inspire. On Lesbos, the epicenter of the refugee crisis in Europe last year, I witnessed the similarities in dynamics between hosting refugees on a refugee camp and hosting a crowd on a music festival. We believe many insights from the festival industry can be integrated to redefine a refugee camp from a Spartan fashionlike environment to an inspiring festivallike experience.\r\n\r\nAdding to the festival game innovative solutions\/companies, educational programs and integration of the refugee community in the management and self-sustainability of their camp will create an environment of harmony and dignity that will be an example in how to change a global issue into an opportunity that can serve humanity on a global scale. \r\n\r\nJoin me in this quest to redefine the global concept of a refugee camp to a campUS.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-09-03T14:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-03T16:00:00+00:00"}],"title":"Camp To CampUS","event_id":17771,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":17771,"url":"","location":"Camp Mystic","print_description":"The outdated global model of a refugee camp needs to change from a Spartan fashion like to a festival fashion like environment.","event_type":{"label":"Class\/Workshop","id":3,"abbr":"work"},"other_location":"Healing Dome"},"445":{"uid":"kEZ7SoEemWGHzzcnEPQX","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IGZIEA4","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-09-02T11:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T13:00:00+00:00"}],"check_location":0,"id":18572,"event_type":{"id":3,"abbr":"work","label":"Class\/Workshop"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Card Magic, Making Connections","event_id":18572,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"card-magic-making-connections","url":"http:\/\/www.polyparadise.com\/playa-events.htm","contact":"jackarnow1@gmail.com","location":"PolyParadise","print_description":"Yes, you've seen card tricks before, but this magic show has been developed by and especially for burners.

As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project\/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T11:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T11:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T11:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T11:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T11:30:00+00:00"}],"title":"The Arts of Buon Fresco Revealed","event_id":18815,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":18815,"url":"http:\/\/insanelycurious.com","print_description":"Let\u2019s get PLASTERED!

Photographs made of paper with traditional chemicals and no digital input. The Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.","other_location":""},"562":{"uid":"ReaZNChZCqN9H9d5pgDY","hosted_by_camp":null,"year":2016,"event_source":"bmapi","check_location":0,"slug":"exploring-connections-level-1-acrovinyasatm","desc":"Tuesday 7\/30\r\n10-11:30am\r\nUniverse University presents:\r\n\"Exploring Connections\" a level 1 ACROVINYASA\u2122 class with Eudaimonia Yoga\r\nBroaden the understanding and connection of self with this dynamic practice.

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

It is an open-eye meditation technique that focuses on the breath while also taking in your surroundings. The walking meditation focuses on the sensation your feet feel while walking at a slow place in a small circle. This practice helps form a connection with the earth as a sense of grounding. With practice, this technique helps one discover who they really are, not who they feel they are supposed to be. It has done wonders for me and truly changed my life.

Will death be the end of life? The pain experienced in the lead-up to death or the manner death is portrayed may have lasting impressions on how we determine our own death. If death is a passage and a natural step, like a leaf that falls and disintegrates into the earth, how do we best prepare to be ready, at a moments notice to fall onto earth, without a shred of remorse, guilt or unpacked potential? This workshop is about giving yourself a chance to look deeper into death with a clean slate. Determine your own method to prepare for death and live life with an openness to dying.

These mirrors reflect you as you are, not reversed, and are truly magical!  \r\n\r\nTheres both science and an art here - your face \"works\" when you see it as it truly is.  In contrast it stops working, and you tend to stare at yourself in mirrors. Then get self-critical all too often. Even if you are feeling wonderful, like all so many times at Burning Man, a mirror doesn't reflect it naturally, so you tend to lose that sparkle and start to question your good feelings.  \r\n\r\nIn contrast, when you look in one of these true reflection mirrors, your face keeps working!  Your eyes, which have so much beautiful information in them, continue to have that same information that you can see.  This is what we see and read so well when we look at you.  That sparkle when you are happy, that depth when you are being deep, that vitality and genuineness that we know about you, now you can see it too!  So easy to believe in yourself when you see all that true energy you have. \r\n\r\nThe result?  Expect to be absolutely floored.  You are an amazing creature - a Human Being, and now you can see what that really looks, and feels like.  The feedback loop you find yourself in now is clear and complete, so smiles look like real smiles and you will smile back.  Complete with sparkle!!! Beautiful!\r\n\r\nThere's lots of posters in the Palace (which is made from giant tinker style toys) to explain it all.  If you don't see the magic, ask one of us for a demo and explanation. .. we want to get you to your own AHA moment!   \r\n\r\nNote-this is the same Palace that has been under the Man, on Playa, on Esplanade and in Center Camp!

No drop offs allowed, when you get there you will help us quickly separate your cans before riding the Crushinator, our magical bicycle-powered can crushing apparatus, to compact the cans so we can store as many as possible before scrapping the aluminum off-site. All of the money we generate from can recycling is donated to the Gerlach school system. We only accept aluminum cans so please keep all of your soup or heavy metal cans. If you are unsure if it is aluminum a good rule of thumb is if you can't crush it, then we don't want it. Also, some stout beers like Guinness also have a plastic widget that cannot be recycled with the aluminum, please remove of be conscious of it before bringing them to us. PROTIP from the Recyclenauts: bring a MESH bag to store all of your cans in. Plastic bags won't allow your cans to dry out, so please store them in a mesh bag before bringing them over to Recycle Camp and help make things a little less juicy for us when we crush them.

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop\/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project\/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T14:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T14:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T14:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T14:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T14:30:00+00:00"}],"title":"The Arts of Buon Fresco Revealed","event_id":19808,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":19808,"url":"http:\/\/insanelycurious.com","print_description":"Let\u2019s get PLASTERED!

Truth is, we are much more likely to remember something if we hear it in a story then just the facts.

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

This contact can actually induce the production of a pair bonding hormone, called oxytocin, in the human brain, similar to how you feel when you hug or kiss a loved one. \r\n\r\nThrough the sensation of touch and dance, you can explore organic movement generated through and with, one-another, forming new bonds and strengthening old ones.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by a variety of musicians, this session will begin with some simple guiding prompts to help individuals become familiar with touching as well as giving\/receiving weight. As the jam progresses individuals get to explore movement by listening and responding to their partner\/partners through touch. There are no right or wrong answers and you do not need prior dance training to participate. \r\n\r\nThe central characteristic of Contact Improvisation is a focus on bodily awareness and physical reflexes rather than consciously controlled movements.  Much like meditation, Contact Improvisational Dance seeks to honor the present moment by guiding the dancers to surrender what is happening now. \r\n\r\n\u201cOne learns to recognize and differentiate subtle impulses in our movement choices and our partner's choices. We begin to decipher the cues that we give and receive which tell us when to lead or follow, when to go up, when to go down, where to touch, how to lift, when to slow down, and when to be still. In this form one learns to stay in integrity with each choice, never forcing, never rushing. When Body, Mind, and Spirit are united in their instinctive wisdom one finds ones-self at home in every moment expressing ones true nature.\u201d     \r\n\r\n- Moti Zemelman","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-30T15:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T16:15:00+00:00"}],"title":"Contact Improv : A Meditative Dance Technique","event_id":20587,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":20587,"url":"","contact":"brooklynnreeves@yahoo.com","location":"Hello, We Love you!","print_description":"Through the sensation of touch and dance, we explore organic movement generated through and with, one-another.","event_type":{"label":"Class\/Workshop","id":3,"abbr":"work"},"other_location":""},"1221":{"uid":"44RLXmz7skHmpb4rLw7X","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IQfrEAG","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-30T18:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T00:00:00+00:00"}],"check_location":0,"id":18943,"event_type":{"id":2,"abbr":"prty","label":"Gathering\/Party"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Is salsa","event_id":18943,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"is-salsa","url":"","location":"Dr. Realz' Steampunk Sideshow","print_description":"Get your dance on!

Five years ago we completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and gave it a new name: The Orgasamator. When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience. Your specific needs and desires will be discussed at the beginning, and the experience will be fine-tuned to give you exactly what you want. No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

For the first time ever, Burning Man is hosting a series of workshops in a Florentine piazza-style format to have Masters of various craftsmanship skills teach our students the arts of the Renaissance. \r\n\r\nWe, The Three Faced (Stone) Wench Workshop\/Guild, are offering a series of classes you would love to attend! \r\n\r\nHere\u2019s the scoop:\r\n\r\nApprentices will learn the various actual old time techniques over several days to create a fresco (block) from scratch to take home. As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project\/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T17:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T17:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T17:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T17:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T09:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T17:00:00+00:00"}],"title":"All You Need Is Love","event_id":18183,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":18183,"url":"http:\/\/insanelycurious.com","contact":"ritualsart@aol.com","print_description":"A community project to create a secco fresco artwork stretching across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida.","event_type":{"label":"Class\/Workshop","id":3,"abbr":"work"},"other_location":"Guild Workshops -- At the Man"},"1395":{"uid":"LJ4MGQd62sMSJosToW5N","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IWT1EAO","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T17:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T17:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T17:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T17:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T17:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-03T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-03T17:30:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-04T16:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-04T17:30:00+00:00"}],"check_location":0,"id":19383,"event_type":{"id":12,"abbr":"none","label":"None"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Daily AnyS Meeting","event_id":19383,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"daily-anys-meeting","url":"http:\/\/www.burnanon.org","contact":"spiralforward@gmail.com","location":"Anonymous Village","print_description":"Radically Inclusive recovery meeting where you are free to identify in accordance with Any Sex-Related 12-step Program  (SLAA, SAA, SCA, CoSA, etc...)","desc":"A Radically Inclusive 12-step recovery meeting where you are free to identify in accordance with Any 12-step Sex-Related Program traditions (SLAA, SAA, SCA, CoSA etc\u2026) We are never alone--even in the dust!

Nothing wrong with it per se \u2013 it is part of who we are. It is how the human race continues. \r\n \r\n And, we are more.\r\n \r\n This powerful energy can also be directed up and through the heart. And when it is, that force of energy has the power to soften the heart and break through walls we may have built up around it (fear, resentment, grudges, and other things that keep us from feeling our own Divinity). If the heart is open and cleansed, energy can move into that space. When it does, it creates a pleasure that makes sex seem rather mundane. The energy gets transmuted into spiritual power and ecstasy \u2013 Pure Love.\r\n \r\n In this workshop, we will use the power of yin and yang, platonic (non-sexual) touch and loving friendship to soften, expand and ignite the heart with Pure Love.\r\n \r\n Using the Light of our eyes and the Energy that moves through our hands and hearts we will connect with each other, swim in Love and glorify the Divinity within our hearts.\"","other_location":""},"1476":{"uid":"wSSdcYcT3syzu38RosmC","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IXPvEAO","year":2016,"event_source":"bmapi","check_location":0,"slug":"pancakes-can-be-sexy-brunch","desc":"Providing pancakes to those in need of a little sexy, at Camp IAMU","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-09-04T10:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-04T12:00:00+00:00"}],"title":"Pancakes Can Be Sexy Brunch","event_id":18594,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":18594,"url":"","location":"Home Rule Village","print_description":"Providing pancakes to those in need of a little sexy, at Camp IAMU","event_type":{"label":"Food","id":5,"abbr":"food"},"other_location":""},"1477":{"uid":"AHUmnUsRTXhQoPJz6ETZ","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IAzrEAG","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T15:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-30T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T15:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-08-31T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-31T15:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T15:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-02T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-02T15:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-03T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-03T15:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-04T12:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-04T15:00:00+00:00"}],"check_location":0,"id":20483,"event_type":{"id":3,"abbr":"work","label":"Class\/Workshop"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Figure Drawing at Art Model Camp","event_id":20483,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"figure-drawing-at-art-model-camp","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/Art-Model-Camp-at-Burning-Man-235987613086327\/","location":"Alternative Energy Zone","print_description":"A place for figure drawing\/posing (no exp nec).

In cognitive psychology FOMO is known as loss aversion.  Loss aversion refers to people's tendency to strongly prefer avoiding losses to acquiring gains. Most studies suggest that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.  Basically FOMO is the losing out on what others are currently experiencing and valuing it higher than the gain of your current experience.  An early example of FOMO comes from Tulipmania in Holland in the 1590s.  Seeing and hearing others buy into the promises of tulip profitability encouraged others to do the same. Nobody wanted to be the one missing out. \r\n\r\nWhen you lose something it hurts and often to avoid this negative emotion strange behavior may occur. This talk will give insight into why FOMO occurs and illustrate that it happens not only to Millennials anxious about what experiences their peers are having, but also to those making business and investment decisions.","other_location":""},"1674":{"uid":"7hK2C2qLgjZEztUtXqP2","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IXTSEA4","year":2016,"event_source":"bmapi","check_location":0,"slug":"town-hall-meeting","desc":"A live, pseudo-official, satirical meeting where citizens of Black Rock City come together to debate proposed future changes to the event.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-30T11:30:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T12:30:00+00:00"}],"title":"Town Hall Meeting","event_id":18100,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":18100,"url":"","location":"Yummy RUMInations","print_description":"A live, pseudo-official, satirical meeting where citizens of Black Rock City come together to debate proposed future changes to the event.","event_type":{"label":"Gathering\/Party","id":2,"abbr":"prty"},"other_location":""},"1675":{"uid":"LANPPjvSqvCoL9V8GXKA","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001INXNEA4","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-09-02T23:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-03T00:30:00+00:00"}],"check_location":1,"id":20167,"event_type":{"id":7,"abbr":"perf","label":"Performance"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Radio Skies @ Reverbia Live Nights","event_id":20167,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"radio-skies-reverbia-live-nights","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/ReverbiaCamp","location":"Reverbia","print_description":"Prepare to Journey into the Unknown Cosmos with Folk Roots Live Electro Psychedelia Dance Music from the mountains of Ojai\u2026in total convergence!","desc":"Reverbia Welcomes Radio Skies for their first year in Black Rock City.

This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa.

No penetration is involved, but sexy talk and sensual touch are available options. We want everyone to feel refreshed and respected when they leave. We are strongly focused on cleanliness and health, along with fun. Come solo, or bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience. Wear as much or as little as you would like, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense. If you are a woman, 18+, the Orgasamator Experience is something you won't want to miss.

This practice is not dance, body expression, theater, nor performance \u2014 it is a composition of these, and more. We will use the intelligence of the movement to communicate. \r\n \r\n You can move being encouraged and guided by the intelligence of morphic fields (Rupert Sheldrake has published credible research about this). A morphic field is a field of energy that stores information; in the field exist dynamics, settings, games, processes; it is a memory field, it is an intelligent field. A morphic field is created when any of us introduces an intention and an action in space and time, which after being performed several times becomes a specific intelligence, then that intelligence influences the actions of a whole group and creates a memory of a way of doing things. We can create morphic fields at will, because our intelligence is able to. In a morphic field the communication is easy and instantaneous. What this workshop proposes is the creation of fields of intelligence through movement, because I believe that as human beings we are prepared to communicate with new languages.

The results of the jury cannot be protested. All performances are scored on a scale from 4.0 to 6.0 \u2013 6.0 being the highest possible. Scores are given to one decimal point (e.g. 5.4, not 5.48). A single score is given to each air guitarist based on their overall performance in that round.\r\n\r\nThe score reflects the quality of the performance based on three key criteria:\r\n\r\n1.\tTechnical merit - You don\u2019t have to know what notes you\u2019re playing, but the more your invisible fretwork corresponds to the music that\u2019s playing, the better the performance.\r\n2.\tStage presence - Anyone can do it in the privacy of their bedroom. Few have what it takes to rock a crowd of hundreds or even thousands \u2013 all without an instrument.\r\n3.\t\u201cAirness\u201d - The last criteria is the most difficult to define yet often the most decisive of all. Airness is defined as the extent to which a performance transcends the imitation of a real guitar and becomes an art form in and of itself.\r\n\r\nPlease note: the scores from BOTH ROUNDS are added to determine the contestants\u2019 final scores. This combined score determines the winner.

This year, in name of \"Radical Self Expression\" we sent out five hundred vinyl toy elephants to kids all over the world and asked them to express themselves by decorating them.  We are then taking those elephants and displaying them at Burning Man under The Man as part of the Guild Workshops piazza.\r\nOur aim is to bring awareness of the importance of creativity in a child's life. Lack of funding has stopped art programs in many public schools across the country. We are figuratively and literally putting the crayon back in the child's hand. We are also bringing 10,000 elephants to the playa this year and letting burners express themselves by decorating the elephants, and gifting them to fellow burners. \r\nWe chose to create a vinyl elephant for the kids to decorate because of the elephant's outstanding memory. We are building positive experiences in children that we want them to remember for a lifetime. \r\nWe also sculpted the elephant into the shape of the Vitruvian Man, as a wink to this year's Burning Man theme.","other_location":"londy24@gmail.com"},"2192":{"uid":"Tj4surMr7RyGXF9vC9Bq","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IM5EEAW","year":2016,"event_source":"bmapi","check_location":0,"slug":"partner-dancing-101","desc":"Come learn basics of partner dancing that will make dancing with others even more fun!

Josie Posie leads a ceremony where the women of the playa welcome the men lovingly at the entrance to the dome, inviting them to match the high vibration they hold. The dome becomes an Ancient temple space. The men then stand in a circle offering unconditional love and healing to the community of women who gather in the center. The women come for healing their trust of the Masculine and to receive their love. This is a hands-off workshop. There is no touching except optional hugging at the end. \r\n\r\nWhen men show up and become the pure presence of their Divine Masculine nature and truly witness them, then women can relax into their loving Divine Feminine nature and fully become that love. As both polarities do this, we transmute cultural wounds in the collective feminine and masculine for all of humanity, co-creating a needed and beautiful new balance.","other_location":""},"2392":{"uid":"Lz7zsUayU55vupwU2p5i","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IVGOEA4","year":2016,"event_source":"bmapi","check_location":0,"slug":"ali-bar-bar","desc":"Visit Ali Bar-Bar, the hottest Bedouin bar west of the Sahara Desert to chill, drink, and dance.

Join us in our annual pilgrimage to use old school pinhole photography on the playa.\r\n\r\nThe Pinhole Project exposes 30 x 40 inch sheets of light sensitive gelatin silver paper. We work with 12 pinhole cameras, created out of 50-gallon cardboard barrels. This size is uniquely suited for capturing the incredible scale and immense diversity of art and culture at Black Rock City. Under the red safelights of the darkroom, photosensitive paper is inserted into the camera body. Exposures range from 40 to 300 seconds, where concentrated beams of sunlight are funnelled through the pinhole and into the camera, creating a negative image of the recorded subject. We maintain a desert darkroom in a shipping container, where we gather to processes, develop and fix about one hundred photographs each Burning Man. These unique images are then exhibited in Illumination Village, Center Camp Cafe, and off-playa. The pinhole camp has been creating large-scale portraits with festival participants since 1999.","occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-29T10:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-29T12:00:00+00:00"}],"title":"Pinhole Camera Photography with Pinhole Project","event_id":17929,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"id":17929,"url":"http:\/\/www.pinholeproject.org","contact":"cawhelan@att.net","location":"Illumination Village","print_description":"Come play with us, we do pinhole photography on the playa!","event_type":{"label":"Class\/Workshop","id":3,"abbr":"work"},"other_location":""},"2477":{"uid":"ekXHDNtow9uzdahvaRyi","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IVHlEAO","year":2016,"occurrence_set":[{"start_time":"2016-08-30T17:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-08-30T18:00:00+00:00"},{"start_time":"2016-09-01T17:00:00+00:00","end_time":"2016-09-01T18:00:00+00:00"}],"check_location":0,"id":19681,"event_type":{"id":3,"abbr":"work","label":"Class\/Workshop"},"event_source":"bmapi","title":"Morrissey Spiritual Healing Happy Hour!","event_id":19681,"located_at_art":null,"all_day":0,"slug":"morrissey-spiritual-healing-happy-hour","url":"","location":"Camp Make Good Choices","print_description":"We know the playa is tough for everyone.

Then dive deep into existentialism explaining why fear has such a programmable hold on our free will, and biology, causing our impulsive actions and thoughts. Then we will explore techniques I've used to transcend my own fears, self-defeating beliefs and habits, freeing myself from years of insecurity, blame, resentment, childhood abuse, guilt from molestation, and general self-hate.

As part of our commitment to up-cycle, we will utilize and recycle actual (old foam insulation) building materials. Participants will learn to recreate various historical stone mixtures that compromise the the surfaces of the block, complete with plastering, cartooning, and finally the stages of painting the actual fresco with pigments. This artifact creation will be followed by (and applied) techniques to 'age' their artwork with the patina and craquelure of passing time. The result? A beautiful, yet portable and tangible, aged piece of buon fresco that becomes their momento of inspired learning at Burning Man. ;)\r\n\r\nUpon completing your fresco block, you will receive a Playa Plastered Master of Arts certificate, authorizing you to be plastered anywhere on the playa!\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s not all! \r\n\r\nWe are offering a unique community project\/event, and we invite everyone to participate with your hearts (and energy): \r\n\r\nWe are accomplishing a recreation of Gustav Klimt\u2019s Beethoven Frieze (Ode To Joy), with a slight twist on the theme: \u201cAll You Need Is Love.\u201d The secco fresco artwork will stretch across several large panels, a moving tribute of the people lost at Orlando, Florida, and of our experiences at Burning Man. \r\n\r\nPlease join us! ;o)\r\n\r\nYouth ages 12 and up welcome.","other_location":"Guild Workshops -- At the Man"},"2612":{"uid":"bdAxuUNLdCqRckZ2UDek","hosted_by_camp":"a1Xd0000001IXOYEA4","year":2016,"event_source":"bmapi","check_location":0,"slug":"healing-yourself-using-emotional-freedom-technique","desc":"Emotional Freedom Technique is a simple processing tool that draws from ancient Chinese medicine, neuroscience, and positive psychology.

Domme Sage has learned the ropes over the years and wants to pass her wisdom on to you. She will instruct you, with the help of her assistants and volunteers, on the art of tickling and sensual touch.

We may be requesting volunteers from the audience for some aspects of the class, so if you are eager to be part of this hands on experience let us know.
